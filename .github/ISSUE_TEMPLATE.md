What is the current behavior?

If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

If you want a new resolver, please keep in mind that we want to support all your resolver needs, but do not want to bloat this package. Consider whether the resolver would be useful to most projects. If it is more specialized, consider creating the resolver in a separate package. See [adding custom resolvers](https://github.com/jdolle/graphql-json-resolvers#adding-custom-resolvers).
